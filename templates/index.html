<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in the ECE department at Virginia Tech advised by Dr. Ming Jin. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at VT Hume Center of National Security and Technology at Arlington. My work focuses on developing machine learning models for anomaly/outlier 
          detection along with resilience and robustness to anomalies and adversaries in power grids, water distribution systems and in cyber-security.
</p>
<p>Previously, I received a Masters in Computer Engineering in the ECE dept. at VT with specilization in Machine Learning. My work focuses on developing machine learning models for anomaly/outlier 
          detection along with resilience and robustness to anomalies and adversaries in power grids, water distribution systems and in cyber-security. 
</p>
<p>Before joining VT, I used to work as a Data Science engineer at Accenture AI (2017-18) and as a Software Developer at Accenture Digital (2015-16)   </p>
<p>There, I worked in various client projects and implemented machine learning and deep learning models in production systems. I also worked as part of a data analytics team where we developed microservices with Python in cloud platforms.</p>

<li><p> We propose a joint objective function which leverages a robust form of the Mahalanobis distance using median and MAD to measure correlation in latent space and a non-parametric kernel distance measure to maximize the mutual information between latent space and prior space in order to detect both near and far anomalies. We tested our methods with a communication signals dataset and a cybersecurity datset. Our method is efficient in detecting both near and far anomalies efficiently. The model also proves to be a better generative model with minimum reconstruction loss. The work is submitted at PAKDD. Future work includes developing  a meta model for domain generalization that can detect previously unseen attacks. We emphasize on learning the prior kernel more accurately with deep GP, defining the bound for the covariance matrix for domain genearlization and measuring the layerwise mutual information of the autoencoder model using semi-supervised learning. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00462.pdf">Link</a> </p>

<li><p> The deployment of distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) to  control voltage distribution in cyber-physical power system is increasing. However, the DERMS controller communication lines are vulnerable to intrusions that could potentially harm the real world. Model-based intrusion detection techniques are data-centric but an undetected attack on the data could lead to making wrong operational decisions for the system. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization problem to build a robust model to defend against simultaneous poisoning and evasion attacks in cyber-physical power system. The proposed method is tested on
IEEE-13 bus feeder model. Using diverse poisoning and evasion attacks scenarios, the proposed method performed better compared to the existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. Paper submitted at IFAC. In future, we focus on developing an end-to-end uncertainty estimation model by modeling the time series as a GP and determine the robustness under different proportions and magnitudes of attack scenarios. <a href="https://bibbase.org/network/publication/ulabdeen-roy-altawaha-jia-freeman-beling-liu-sangiovannivincentelli-etal-defenseagainstjointpoisoningandevasionattacksacasestudyofderms-2022">Link</a></p>

<li><p>Incorporating county-level mobility information in improving COVID-19 forecasting both in
        terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Proposed a new architecture based on
        Auto-regressive Mixed Density Networks on a county-level graph network and it beats
        some of the state of the art deep learning models. We received an invitation to extend our paper for the SNAM journal (IF 3.96). Paper published in IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2021 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3487351.3488334">ASONAM 2022</a> .Future works include understanding the higher order interactions between different dynamic and static features and how it is affecting the uncertainty quantification of the prediction.</p>

<li><p>In a graph network, an individual node often fails to detect some unique anomalies when each node is modeled independently. The goal of this project is to develop a Gaussian Copula index in order to measure the correlation between multiple time series while modeling the conditional distribution and find out if it helps to detect some unique anomalies. The other purpose is to design a robust regression model which will be robust to outliers in the data using a modified version of generalized maximum likelihood estimator for accurate forecasting in presence of outliers.</p>
